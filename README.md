## 🤖 AI Collaboration

This project was developed with the assistance of **GitHub Copilot Chat** as required by the bootcamp. All AI interactions are documented in [`ai-usage-log.md`](./ai-usage-log.md).

**AI was used for:**
- Debugging CSS and JavaScript issues
- Explaining complex concepts (animations, scope)
- Code suggestions and best practices
- Translation and documentation

**I maintained control over:**
- Project design and requirements
- Game flow and UX decisions
- Code structure and organization
- All creative choices

---

## 🎨 Design Choices

**Color Scheme:**
- Background: Deep Purple `#26006e`
- Text: Off-white `#F5F5F5`
- Accent: Cyan `#00E5FF`
- Hover effects with shadows and transforms

**Typography:**
- Font: Arial, sans-serif
- Clear hierarchy with different sizes

**Layout:**
- Flexbox for centering and responsive design
- Clean, minimal interface
- Visual feedback on interactions

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- JavaScript class syntax and `this` context
- DOM manipulation best practices
- CSS animations with `@keyframes`
- Event handling and delegation
- Debugging techniques
- Project organization and documentation
- Working with AI as a development tool

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. Complete game page UI
2. Implement game logic (play round, determine winner)
3. Add score tracking
4. Create end game screen
5. Add animations and polish
6. Test thoroughly
7. Deploy online
